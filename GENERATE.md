Ok, I would like you to help me make a studyguide - in *Swedish*. 

To do this, start by checking the "subject" folder of the project for the material that the guide should cover. Then follow the instructions in @STYLEGUIDE.md and generally follow the structure of @healthguide.html to the extent that is helpful to the new guide. Generate a new HTML file for the guide, as well as a guide specific database of at least 30 questions (similar to @healthquiz.js ).

Ensure that you add the guide to @index.html in the same way that the other guides have been added to the index.

Besides edits to index.html you are not allowed to edit any files - only the new HTML file and the new js DB file for questions and answers.

Make sure to give the study guide a unique id (the existing ID:s are defined in index.html so you can avoid collissions).

Include @studyguide-core.js and @interactive-quiz.js to make sure we get achievements and quizzes properly implemented. Make sure that there are study questions under each section, in addition to the actual quiz, just like in @healthguide.html.
