Ok, I would like you to help me make a studyguide - in *Swedish*. 

To do this, start by checking the "subject" folder of the project for the material that the guide should cover. Then follow the instructions in @STYLEGUIDE.md. Use the same folder as for the other guides - they can be found in the studyguides folder in the root of the project. Generally follow the structure of @healthguide.html (/studyguides/health1/@healthguide.html) to the extent that is helpful to the new guide. Create a new folder for the guide and generate a new HTML file for the guide, as well as a guide specific database of at least 30 questions (similar to @healthquiz.js ) in the created folder.

Ensure that you add the guide to @index.html in the same way that the other guides have been added to the index.

Make sure to give the study guide a unique id (the existing ID:s are defined in index.html so you can avoid collissions).

Include @studyguide-core.js and @interactive-quiz.js in the html file to make sure we get achievements and quizzes properly implemented. Make sure that there are study questions under each section, in addition to the actual quiz, just like in @healthguide.html.


Besides edits to index.html you are not allowed to edit any files - only the new HTML file and the new js DB file for questions and answers.
