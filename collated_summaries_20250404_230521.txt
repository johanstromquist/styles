## hBC7i-vHWsU_What_causes (Folder: hBC7i-vHWsU_What_causes)

Key Point 1: Here's a summary of the transcript segment:

Substance abuse disorder affects over 36 million people worldwide, with addiction being a severe end of the spectrum. Addictive substances can alter brain chemistry, leading to tolerance and dependence. When someone uses a substance repeatedly, their brain adapts to its presence, making them more susceptible to withdrawal and cravings when it's absent. The brain's reward pathway, which is responsible for pleasure and motivation, is exploited by addictive substances, making it difficult to control use.

Different substances have unique effects on the brain, but all alter the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Repeated use can lead to changes in brain regions responsible for decision-making and habit learning, making it harder to quit. Some people

Key Point 1: Here is a summary of the transcript segment:

The speaker explains that stress is a natural, evolutionary response that has been present for millions of years. However, in today's society, stress is often prolonged, leading to chronically elevated cortisol levels, which can cause problems in the brain. Prolonged stress can lead to decreased brain power, increased activity in the stress system, and even brain disease if left unchecked. However, research has shown that mindfulness and regular physical activity can help reduce cortisol levels, allow the brain to recover, and even grow back to normal size.
